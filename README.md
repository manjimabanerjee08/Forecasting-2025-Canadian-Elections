# Forecasting-2025-Canadian-Elections
Forecasting elections has been prominent in political science for the past 40 years. Once supposed to be a part of research and education, forecasting has recently grabbed the attention of rival online and media forecasters. It is integral for the public to be aware of the right predictions for elections as it may subconsciously impact their baseline expectations and ideologies before placing a vote.
Several studies show how Canada’s elections are majorly affected by an individual voter’s demographic factors by affecting their voting behavior. Thus, in order to make electoral predictions, we must take into account factors such as gender, race, religion, age, region of residence, wealth etc. These factors act as determinants for the result of elections for political parties.
The objective of this study is to find the overall popular vote for the Canadian federal election by focusing on the likelihood of individuals to vote for Liberal Party. Through this study, we can determine the outcome as well as the uncertainty that comes with our prediction. In a deeper sense, we are able to understand the behavior of voters and their thoughts around governance changes due to certain changes in their personal lives.
